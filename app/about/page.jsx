                I'm a passionate and results-driven Computer Science
                undergraduate at San Francisco State University with a strong
                foundation in full-stack software development and game design.
                Through hands-on internships and personal projects, I've gained
                practical experience building scalable applications using
                JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Django. Iâ€™ve led and
                contributed to projects ranging from AI-powered tools and job
                automation platforms to 2D/3D educational and horror games in
                Unity using C#. I enjoy turning complex ideas into user-focused,
                real-world solutions and thrive in environments that challenge
                me to learn fast, think critically, and build with purpose.
